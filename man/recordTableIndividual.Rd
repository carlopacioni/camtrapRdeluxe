\title{
Generate a single-species record table with individual identification from camera trap images
}
\description{
The function generates a single-species record table containing individual IDs, e.g. for (spatial) capture-recapture analyses. It prepares input for the function \code{\link{spatialDetectionHistory}}.
}
\usage{
recordTableIndividual(inDir,
  hasStationFolders,

  cameraID,
  camerasIndependent,
  minDeltaTime = 0,

  timeZone,
  stationCol,
  writecsv = FALSE,

)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{inDir}{
  character. Directory containing images of individuals. Must end with species name (e.g. ".../speciesImages/Clouded Leopard")
}
  \item{hasStationFolders}{
  logical. Does \code{inDir} have station subdirectories? If \code{TRUE}, station IDs will be taken from directory names. If \code{FALSE}, they will be taken from image filenames (requires images renamed with \code{\link{imageRename}}).
}
  \item{IDfrom}{
  character. Read individual ID from image metadata ("metadata") of from directory names ("directory")?
}
  \item{cameraID}{
  character. Should the function look for camera IDs in the image file names? If so, set to 'filename'. Requires images renamed with \code{\link{imageRename}}. If missing, no camera ID will be assigned and it will be assumed there was 1 camera only per station.
}
  \item{camerasIndependent}{
  logical. If \code{TRUE}, cameras at a station are assumed to record individuals independently. If \code{FALSE}, cameras are assumed to be non-independent (e.g. in pairs). Takes effect only if there was more than 1 camera per station and cameraID = "filename".
}
  \item{minDeltaTime}{
  numeric. time difference between observation of the same individual at the same station/camera to be considered independent (in minutes)
}
  \item{deltaTimeComparedTo}{
  character. For two records to be considered independent, must the second one be at least \code{minDeltaTime} minutes after the last independent record of the same individual (\code{"lastIndependentRecord"}), or \code{minDeltaTime} minutes after the last record (\code{"lastRecord"})?
}
  \item{timeZone}{
  character. \code{timeZone} must be an argument of \code{\link[base]{OlsonNames}}
}
  \item{stationCol}{
  character. Name of the camera trap station column in the output table.
}
  \item{writecsv}{
  logical. Should the individual record table be saved as a .csv file?
}
  \item{outDir}{
  character. Directory to save csv file to. If NULL and \code{writecsv = TRUE}, the output csv will be written to \code{inDir}.
}
  \item{metadataHierarchyDelimitor}{
  character. The character delimiting hierarchy levels in image metadata tags in field "HierarchicalSubject". Either "|" or ":".
}
  \item{metadataIDTag}{
  character. In custom image metadata, the individual ID tag name.
}
  \item{additionalMetadataTags}{
  character. additional camera model-specific metadata tags to be extracted. (If possible specify tag groups as returned by \code{\link{exifTagNames}})
}
  \item{removeDuplicateRecords}{
  logical. If there are several records of the same individual at the same station (also same camera if cameraID is defined) at exactly the same time, show only one?
}
}
\details{
The function can handle a number of different ways of storing images. In every case, images need to be stored in a species directory first (e.g. using function \code{\link{getSpeciesImages}}). Station subdirectories are optional. Camera subdirectories are not allowed. This directory structure can be created easily with function \code{\link{getSpeciesImages}}.

As with species identification, individuals can be identified in 2 different ways: by moving images into individual directories ("Species/Station/Individual/XY.JPG" or "Species/Individual/XY.JPG") or by metadata tagging (without the need for individual directories: "Species/XY.JPG" or "Species/Station/XY.JPG").

\code{minDeltaTime} is a criterion for temporal independence of records of an individual at the same station/location. Setting it to 0 will make the function return all records. \code{camerasIndependent} defines if the cameras at a station are to be considered independent (e.g. \code{FALSE} if both cameras face each other and possibly \code{TRUE} if they face different trails).
\code{stationCol} is the station column name to be used in the resulting table. Station IDs are read from the station directory names if \code{hasStationFolders = TRUE}. Otherwise, the function will try to extract station IDs from the image filenames (requires images renamed with \code{\link{imageRename}}.

If individual IDs were assigned with image metadata tags, \code{metadataIDTag} must be set to the name of the metadata tag group used for individual identification. \code{metadataHierarchyDelimitor} is "|" for images tagged in DigiKam and images tagged in Adobe Bridge/ Lightroom with the default settings.
Manufacturer-specific Exif metadata tags such as "AmbientTemperature" or "MoonPhase" can be extracted if specified in \code{additionalMetadataTags}. Multiple names can be specified as a character vector as: \code{c(Tag1, Tag2, ...)}. Because they are not standardized, function \code{\link{exifTagNames}} provides a vector of all available tag names. The metadata tags thus extracted may be used as individual covariates in spatial capture-recapture models.


}
\value{
A data frame containing species records with individual IDs and additional information about stations, date, time and (optionally) further metadata.
}

\section{Warning }{
Be sure to read the section on individual identification in the package vignette (\url{https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=camtrapR/vignettes/SpeciesIndividualIdentification.html}).

Af you use image metadata tags for identification, the tags must be written to the image metadata. The function cannot read tags from .xmp sidecar files. Make sure you set the preferences of your image management software accordingly. In DigiKam, go to Settings/Configure digiKam/Metadata. There, make sure "Write to sidecar files" is unchecked.

Please note the section about defining argument \code{timeZone} in the vignette on data extraction (accessible via \code{vignette("DataExtraction")} or online (\url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=camtrapR/vignettes/DataExtraction.html})).
