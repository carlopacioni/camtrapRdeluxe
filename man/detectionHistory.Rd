\title{
Species detection histories for occupancy analyses
}
\description{
This function generates species detection histories that can be used in occupancy analyses, e.g. with package \code{\link[unmarked]{unmarked}}. It generates detection histories in different formats, with adjustable occasion length and occasion start time.

\details{
The function computes a species detection matrix, either as a detection-by-date or a detection-by-occasion matrix. \code{day1} defines if each stations detection history will begin on that station's setup day (\code{day1 = "station"}) or if all station's detection histories have a common origin (the day the first station was set up if \code{day1 = "survey"} or a fixed date if, e.g. \code{day1 = "2015-12-31"}). If \code{day1} is a date, \code{\link[base]{as.Date}} must be able to understand it. The most suitable format is "\%Y-\%m-\%d", e.g. "2015-12-31".

\code{includeEffort} controls whether an additional effort matrix is computed or not. This also affects the detection matrices. If \code{includeEffort = FALSE}, all occasions in which a station was not set up or malfunctioning (NA or 0 in \code{camOp}) will result in NAs in the detection history. If \code{includeEffort = TRUE}, the record history will only contain 0 and 1, and no NAs. The effort matrix can then be included in occupancy models as a (continuous) observation covariate to estimate the effect of effort on detection probability.

The number of days that are aggregated is controlled by \code{occasionLength}. \code{occasionStartTime} can be used to make occasions begin another hour than midnight (the default). This may be relevant for nocturnal animals, in which 1 whole night would be considered an occasion.
The values of \code{stationCol} in \code{recordTable} must be matched by the row names of \code{camOp} (case-insensitive), otherwise an error is raised.
\code{DateTimeFormat} defaults to "\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S", e.g. "2014-09-30 22:59:59". For details on how to specify date and time formats in R see \code{\link[base]{strptime}}.

}
\value{
Depending on the value of \code{includeEffort} and \code{scaleEffort}, a list with either 1, 2 or 3 elements. The first element is the species detection history. The second is the optional effort matrix and the third contains the effort scaling parameters.
  \item{detection_history}{A species detection matrix}
  \item{effort}{A matrix giving the number of active camera trap days per station and occasion (= camera trapping effort). It is only returned if \code{includeEffort = TRUE}}
  \item{effort_scaling_parameters}{Scaling parameters of the effort matrix. It is only returned if \code{includeEffort} and \code{scaleEffort} are \code{TRUE}}
}
